its a good assessment Apps but still need little improvement to be perfect one.,0
Not fit for purpose. Like a bad computer game marketing itself as a psychometric test.,0
Happy,1
"Remote Desktop is useless. My Samsung A50 is full screen landscape but no keyboard is available. And while testing with my ASUS gaming laptop open in front of when I was able the press the Windows key, after a long time the menu popped out on the phone screen but the laptop showed no such thing. So not really Remote Desktop.",0
NICE,1
A different way to be assessed,1
Ok,1
Interesting approach!,1
"Not connecting or sharing data ,pls improve",1

"This works fine for me.. a good double game to while away a free minutes. Good as multiplayer too. Only negative is that some hints require watching an add, which would be fine if some of the videos weren't longer than the timer you have left to guess the word.",1
Your sales team deserve a big raise. This app is a scam 😂,0
It was ok,1
Removed all but one complication. Dick move. Uninstalled.,0
👎🏻,0
"I do not feel that a task like this is an accurate reflection of how I would perform in a professional environment or reflect anybodies skillset at all. It was simply memory and hand eye coordination, this does not reflect how people may interact with potential clients or how they would manage their work load in the slightest. This is akin to the personality tests that are popular currently. Whilst something a bit different the fact is that different is not always better or good.",0
Stupid app. I passed all the test and still got rejected. Shove this app up ya back side where the sun dont shine. Especially to the Capita company. Capita ur full of BS..!!!!!!!!!,0
Uuu,0
So wonderful,1
Very enjoyable,1
What is this? This doesn't test anything. It's utter luck. I'm not the type that stays on phone to play a 2 yr old child game. Where are we going with all these digital age things... Frustrating!!!,0
Worst app ever,0
It was fun and cannot be cheated which probably makes this good for employers. Hopefully the results are positive. On the lightbulb and gears test and shapes/numbers test my phone wouldn't react to my touch as my room was cold (cold fingers). This heavily impacted my results so I'd recommend a really good device and a warm room!,0
Can't send anything after updation.,0

Useless app,0
"Very good way of assessing you, as it engages all types of people, I found it enjoyable",1
Boladi,1
"The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that -although I knew it- I was part of an experiment. Thus, interesting but cautious on whether it was a good decision to let any corporation have that kind of data.",1
"Seems a strange way to test ability to do a particular type of work, more aimed at lightning fast visual reactions.",1
"While the concept is good, the tasks are inane and often patternless, leading to massive frustration, or impossible. The sound and visual design is irritating and distracting.",0
"Useless, need too many unnecessary permissions",0
"I got 10,381 I believe this is a relatively high score. Much of the game seems to be based on testing your reaction speed, pretty pointless. I found myself getting bored at some points and tapping randomly too.",0
Whan I was reboot the mobile at the time appear in screen your device is currupted press cotinues power button,1
How to play,1
"Don't download this game unless you enjoy watching endless ads, had to sit through 3 of them just to start playing, and the game itself is terrible as well, avoid.",0
"the experience trying to navigate my phone from my ASUS touch laptop is terrible and laggy, and there seems a unsolvable conflict between the mouse cursor and your actual touching points, and where is the ""live real person call assistant"" AS SHOWN IN THE WELCOME ICON of MyASUS..???",0
Interactive,1
"Cannot conect this app with my huawei p9 i try all sorts of ways, just stack on that front page where says conect.",0

It's always failed to transfer file from PC to Phone!,0
Can't scan my BARR CODE and I don't have a pairing Code either why do I have to battle so much SEND ME THE PAIRING CODE PLEASE !!!!,0
"Nice games, but I would definitely not recommend it for having it as a screening test for job applications.",0
Very good experience,1
"Fun but terrifying! The games itself doesn't feel like a tedious assement however my results are nothing like how I approach my work, it makes me sounds impulsive and emotional which isn't me at all, it's terrifying to think that from a few games this inaccurate representation of me is going to be used to see if I'm right for a job. Thanks but no thanks, feel like I've lost all chances of getting this job.",0
Controls are bad. Crashing some times.,0
"Government has had its pants pulled down by this developer. Awful app and waste of taxpayer money. The faces game is embarrassingly bad, borderline racist. Lever game broken. Balloons game has balloons popping with no clear reason why. Fingerprint game lags to the point where it's dumb luck. A real 'hey fellow kids!' travesty. Unbelievable that someone made this and thought it was a good idea.",0
some sounds take alot of time to work,0
"So far I will go with only one thing as I haven't time to go carefully trough, wich is extremely confusing not gonna point on neuroscience but obviously has a lot to do with ... I dont understand how one can reach a 1000 points in a lavel obviously highest and get the opposite results as very unskilled on the matter like points 2 ?",0
Lots of fun but you need to persevere and be determined!,1
How do i get an account in the game?,1
"Before anyone plays, if you dont open the safe then you ain't getting in.. gg..",1
Easy to use,1
Never connects with my laptop,0
Fun and exciting. It was unique.,1
I want to video call with Surbhi Jyoti please help me,0
"Please remove notification count, it used to be perfect",1
"I found this assessment really interesting. I usually don't paly video games but this assessment was really exciting and I felt some unknown force was pushing me to get the good score, enjoyed it throughout 👍",1
A lot of the levels seem to be based on luck making the game incredibly frustrating since it's assessing you. Similarly a lot of games are based one reaction time so if your phone screen has a delay like mine then you are screwed.,0
"A very different approach! I would be fascinated to see the outcome of the assessment. It certainly isn't the predictable, mundane multiple choice questionnaire that generates an outcome the applicant thinks the recruiter wants to hear! A real test of patience and determination. How do you handle repitition and doing the same thing over and over again? Can you maintain focus? At what point do you quit? Excellent!",1
It was a first time for me very challenging but I got through it,1
2000 Khan,1
Can't connect my smartphone with my Asus pc anymore.,0
Worst app not work as mentioned.,0
"Absolutely loved it. Very fun and challenging, it gets fustrating at some points but just shake it off and keep at it, never give up. If you want a challenge, this be the one.",1
"Cannot link my cell phone, cannot add my cell phone number on my profile on the website. If I could give less than 1 star, I would",0

"I have tried to use the AP however I dont have loggin details,anymore so not able to practice on the ap please can you advise thank you in advance.",0
Updated my laptop yesterday and was forced to use this app whilst using the webcam. The app hasn't worked at all and I've been left irritated and without webcam functionality.,0
"Lever game is hard to play as you don't know how many goes you get at it, which means harder to make a strategy for a better score. The tablet selling one it isn't clear what the goal is, to make money for your team or for the company? Could be clearer. Unless that's the point. If score doesn't matter and just for fun the app should specify at start. Face game some of the expressions are near identical, and many can be wrongly allocated neutral before you see other images of the same character",1
"Looks like a scam to get peoples data, asking people to download through a survey site, the link and app do not work, and payment not given unless can complete a process in an app that doesnt work. 1/10 stars - they get 1 for being imaginative.",1
"I think it was entertaining for the most part. The last task proved impossible, for me at least. Very different, I appreciate the effort that had clearly gone into making this app. Well done",1
A great change from the usual biometric type paper tests. Fun & engaging with catchy graphics all wrapped up in a series of fiendish & challenging 'puzzles' which test you to the max. A nice way to pass over an hour especially if it helps with getting your job. Thanks!!,1
"Not what I was hoping for, first test was copying and pasting a curry recipe. I wanted to double it and it did. However just doubling up on spices when making something like a curry doesn't work like that. The other functions you can find on free websites, its handy but it's just a calculator",0
Super game fantastic,1
"Useless. Device pairing with laptop never works. Help and step by step guide don't fix anything. Waste of time, find other ways to transfer your files.",0
Doesn't detect my RoG laptop despite enabling all permissions and connecting to the same Wifi network. Completely useless.,0
Great for the beginner chemist,1
Awful,0
How do I login?,1
"Nothing like the pictures. The NEON glow is much much thicker and is not configurable at all, you can only have it removed or shown. The numbers are really tiny in digital mode, even if I remove the ""neon"" around it",0
"""Please select device name from list on you pc"" ... What list??? Edit after dev response: I really do have another Bluetooth device connected-my headphones. If having any device connected to the pc in addition to the phone ruins the app's connection then you should rethink about how it should work in the first place. My phone is 'connected' in my pc Bluetooth menu and the phone app still asks me to click on my phone name- that does nothing btw",1
"Ridiculous won't let me put In password, doesn't work properly and is an inaccurate representation",0
Just came across while I was applying for job .. sometimes it's not humanly possible .. but given that it tests your limits. Overall it was a good experience. And a great challenge,1
"This app have very serious security issue, that for screen sharing it is recording our screen continuously, even if we don't casting our mobile screen to laptop",0
I connected my pc with my phone's hotspot and it says devices are not connected on same wifi even other app can work,0
"Total rubbish, this app has costed me multiple jobs even through I have years off experience needed for that job. So I wanted to say thanks for ruining my life can believe that hmps uses this rubbish app to sort out candidates.",0
Shared cam used to work. Now i can only use mirror and extend with my phone,0
I brought it down cause you guys forcing to use the location. Once you change that i will bump up the starts. Thank you,1
Extremely buggy app.,1
Total rubbish will not connect to my laptop at all.,0
"I did 3 timed tests testing different skills (literacy, number sequences and shape pattern sequences) and although I feel I did very well on one test and very badly on another, I got the exact same score for each test (which strikes me as bonkers). I have no idea whether it's good or bad. I expected to get some sort of report or analysis at the end but received nothing - it told me my final score then ended the game. Will I ever find out what it all meant? I'm very confused and unsatisfied! :(",0
Not able to sign in. It keeps showing sign in failed . Please fix it,0
Do not download,0
Nice,1
Really interesting and technical psychometric test.,1
"Nice assessment. Not stressful, it's just playing a game.",1
could not get it to work on chromcast even though it was connected. could not get it to start game,0
"Stupid game. let me out of Cisco. this app make no sense i have passed all stages with 900 - 1000 points per stage, and still i was not selected , i don't know why :/",0
Purchased the game but it wont download on my Samsung Galaxy s8. Please fix,0
👌,0
Lots of fun challenges and it made me want to do them again to beat my previous scores. Very easy to use and clear instructions.,1
better than your average testing,1
Interesting challenging and very innovative. In my opinion the only aspect that could be improved is the emotion recognising test where the computer generated people expressing emotions should be changed with pictures of real people expressing different emotions. Thank you very much for creating this assessment I enjoyed.,1
Good application,1
Some instructions really unclear (e.g. Electric machines) Some tasks complete RNG with no skill involved. I would NEVER recommend using this app to test future employees.,0
Interesting and out of the box Personality test,1
"Its meh, not a huge variety and an ok selection... Pretty sure I'm the first to download as well. There's no way +100 downloaded this.",0
Its good but not necessarily the route id take when recruiting. I prefer an assesment centre and interview.,1
Not user friendly. I tried two times had to uninstall because its not useful to me. Not easy to make phone as web cam. Windows app is not generating the qr code. Cool idea but poor UX,0
"Screen mirror turns Screen brightness off, looking like black screen. The notification of: 'instable connection' is a nightmare: won't remove other then force stop + keeps screen on and phone awake + drains battery. Phone: Xiaomi A2 light",0
"Useless. Followed all directions, connects for a moment, and then returns to ""select a device to pair"" Hours wasted to do nothing.",0
"I inconvenienced myself, deleted some of the best apps in my Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 device to free up more spaces for the app, I wasted my hard earned data to download this app but it won't just install on my device. I have verified and check the apps permission, and downloaded it for more than 3 times, the problem continues. It is sad! A good app is measured by its usability, addiction and accessibility and this has failed the first two tests.",0
good,1
It's a shame that we are now using apps as part of an application for a vacancy. I fail to see how you can accurately place people into personality type using games on your phone.Despite their previous responses it's just really a shame I hope that employers do not continue to use this as part of their processes.,0
It's not that nice you don't have ringtones only message tones are there,0
"Was asked to do this as part of job application. I don't think I'll be going further based on the report!!! I think it's great that companies are being more innovative in how they recruit, but this very much felt like a test of my phone using skills rather than anything else. I'd say I was a pretty self aware person and don't agree with most of the report. That may well be me being deluded but I think it shows limitations of this kind of testing. Maybe it would be more effective if not so long?!",0
"Screen mirroring is having lag, it's not optimized for 5ghz wifi. Still lag why??",0
The app is quite interesting but the results on the cognitive part made me seem pretty stupid,0
"To connect it with your computer, you should spend about 20 minutes. The worst app I've ever seen.",0
The worst app I've ever seen.,0
Overall okay experience,1
lovely,1
"Good to get you mentally going (except the lock game, the last few spins are just a lucky press and require no skill) besides that it is very engaging and fun.",1
You'll need good eyesight and coordination.,1
Why this app ask for accept contact and photo and location?,0
"App crashed multiple times during my assessment which meant I was not able to complete it, potentially jeopardising my internship application.",0
It is quite fun to do and some of the tests are a little bit tricky but it tests your nerve to have go. I think it's good and a positive experience.,1
"Looks great, it'd be nice to be able to change the colors of the complications to match the face.",1
"Exige ver publicidad mientras estas jugando. Como explicas eso??!! Como ves la publicidad si estas jugando. Nota 1, promedio 1. Pesimo juego.",1
Fun,1
CANT BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE USING THIS TO TEST APTITUDE. THE WORST TEST EVER. ITS A FLASH GAME FOR KIDS NOT TO BE USED FOR GRADUATE ASSESMENTS.,0
Terrible way of doing things,0
DUDE I HATE THAT STUPIT MONKEY ISHE IS SO STUPID AND I DON'T LIKE WHAT HE DID TO GOJIRA KONWS AS GODZILA HE IS LIKE GORILLA FROM THE MOVIE CALLED RAMPAGE IT WAS A A GAINTEST GORILLA VS A GAINTEST CROKADILE VS A GAINTEST FOX,0
Insult to the civil service Being an experienced officer I've had my fair share of repetitiveness and patterns forming with inmates but this is a joke. The role is not a game and this test should not depict whether or not to pass to the next stage and also is a misleading first impression to what to expect as a Prison officer,0
The questions kept me on my toes as well as the games,1
"Initially thought this was good, but it turns out when you're told ""there is no right or wrong way to approach these scenarios"" there evidently is! As I somehow didn't get past this test! So be careful people it's lies 🤥",0

"I use the lastest version (august 19 2015), after download and install is completed, i can't open the app, please fix that. My phone OS is Android KitKat.",0
App is very helpful for me,1
Very very very very bad game😧😧🙁🙁☹☹☹,0
Nice,1
App is not responding...even for a minute,0
I've done this assessment 4 times now for different companies. Why are the results always different when it's testing the same thing each time? Surely that means this test is not consistent and therefore a poor measure of my psychology.,0
Its way more easier to just share files across usb...or send links by the mail or any...its bad...i don't even want give it a single. And for some unknown reason 'Can't connect to Laptop' message continues to pop up even after uninstalling the app. Its utter disgusting.,0
This gameis very bad and many ads and grapical is bad i hate is game,0
It can not give me information which I have needs. I want to replace my Asus x00TD mobile display case,0
Interesting test very much in the vane of video games. Many of the tests are reaction based that getting progressively harder the better your reactions. Therefore alertness provided by a good night's sleep will benefit assessment results,1
I love it so much😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘,1

"Just downloaded this app per a job application and the password box doesn't prompt a keyboard, so I can't use the log in to do the test and finish the application",0
Chitiya,1
A few minutes after completing I had a 6 page report telling me what personality/Character type I was. A few minutes after that I had a message saying based on this report I was unsuitable for the position. Did this take into account I have never played a game on me phone before...ever? Did this take into account I have never played any sort of game like this before? A game that seemed to favour the ability to click fast. I work in one of the worlds biggest pharmaceutical companies. None of the people I work with got into those roles through playing a video game. I feel cheated that my application has been dismissed because of this game rather than my actual experience and personality.,0
Cam is not working on windows 11,0
Worst application. Tried with ROG not detecting camera. Worst app ever used. Don't download this trash. I can't believe asus can make trash like this. If they are reading this review they should remove this app.,0

"to say it's a bad recruitment app is an understatement. the app screening for candidates doesn't do justice to hiring companies or the candidates. there are extremely reliable ways of assessing candidates I.e 16pf , shl , capp... When recruiting is about playing games it cant get worse",0
Not very user friendly,0
Train won't move and because of that I can't finish the game.,0
"A great promise, waisted hours trying to make it work, with a new computer and a new phone, logged into Asus account. Nothing. Connection fails.",0
"DO NOT COMPLETE THIS ASSESMENT ON YOUR PC!!! There's option to use on windows but my colleague used a computer and it puts you at a huge disadvantage! I did the mobile version and because of the amount of clicking and the actual type of activities you have to complete, I reccomend if you really want an accurate result to use a mobile or tablet as it's almost impossible to do the speed clicking with a mouse. If you want a fighting chance use your mobile and you will understand why on test day!",0
Very interesting as an assessment. It was my first time and I really enjoyed it although i was very sceptical at first because the training app only provide a general training. Some parts of it are a bit challenging probably this is why it is called an assessment 😅😅.,1
I hatw it because who whats to us the flash its just loght and the qulity is horrable i hate it. Sorey dor tje bad englisg,0

Irrelevant,0
Damn companies tryna milk their consumers money. This app only works if you have another Asus device. Better off with Samsung's DeX. They can just plug an hdmi or just use the app on any computer. What a joke.,0
Overall enjoyed the app and most of the tests really assess one's ability to react in different situations.,1
it was a lot of fun,1
Enjoying each activity. Simple graphic design and instructions. Easy to follow.,1
It's not bad!,1
The purpose of many games was not apparent or badly done e.g. during the competing team game it was impossible to maximise profit for the team or company as the computer simply copied the user input). Additionaly games like the facial emotion recognition suggered due to the poor rendering qualoty of thr faces.,0
excellent test model,1
45-55 minutes my ass. I have doing the lock thing for 30 minutes and still can't do it,0
The link app may be fine but camera app on my laptop is surely not what it should be. When I had automatically installed the app on laptop it blocked the inbuilt camera of my PC and continued to insist to download this link app. Worst still that this app won't work if you provide permission for mic and camera only on your phone. You must provide permission for change of settings as well which is quite dangerous.,0
Hello I have downloaded the app to do my assessment however it won't allow me to out in my password I have uninstall it 3 times and reinstalled it and it is just the same. I can only put it my username. I have also attempted on my laptop and still the same. My WiFi is perfectly fine. Ive been trying to get in touch with someone to help and nothing!,0

"I think this app tells you fairly accurate results for your personality. However, I don't think that most employers will be able to accurately interpret them. For example I came out as way more instinctive. Which is should be true for everyone as we are humans and rely on System 1 thinking. But I fear that most employers would interpret it as you being someone incapable of critical thinking. In the end as you say you produce results driven by accurate neuroscience, the people looking at them most of the time will not be psychologists.",1

A complete waste of time! I downloaded the android app and the windows MyAsus App. It took over an hour just to get to a log in screen in the android app. I had to connect and reconnect my phone to my laptop 3 times. In the end connection in this app failed to connect to my laptop. My experience doesn't come close to the seamless experience in the YouTube video for the android app. I uninstalled both apps.,0

"Overall this wasnt too bad however I dont believe this game should determine whether or not I get a job, I spent hours trying the final task and completed it only to find it had no real impact on my score, this is fun and enjoyable with a little bit of challeng to it however it has nothing to do with the job I'm applying for, this app has potential but it's not yet at the level to determine someone's future, the game or ""assessment"" is mostly a reaction test mostly based off luck.",1
I don't have link to myasus option in my myasus app on my pc!,0
certainly a different way of a doing a test but I found it to be mostly enjoyable. Instructions given to the player explain everyrhing that you need to do clearly ans the last stage was the only difficult section.,0

Dreadful for many many reasons. There's no point in writing a review for this as the developers respond to 90% of their criticism in the same manner. Certainly I will hesitate to apply to companies which decide to use an app produced by such an inept development studio.,0
great app to test ones abilities. It would be nice to see what the average score is from everyone who's played the game to see how you've done. Maybe even a top 10 of the highest scores. No need to post names of the people. Just the scores for those of us who are competitive,1
I put in the link and hit the go button but nothing happens so I hit it again nothing happen so I use different link nothing happen and I'm on galaxy note 9,1
"Paid for it, but when I open the game, hit play, and the game closes out by itself. Very disappointed. Redunded it almost 5 days ago, and still havent seen my money back. Not worth it.",0
"I tried hard, but can't connect my pc to the app. Got problem with network and it's tell me to use same network in mobile and pc. As they are!",0
Giving assessments was fun. But one task had insufficient instructions and was unclear.,0
The test was exactly the same as a traditional online logical reasoning test except it's on your phone so everything's 10x smaller and it's way harder to see what's going on. Beyond pointless.,0
"Very interactive and fun. Personally, I want to know if I have won or not and the game doesn't show that.",0
Some of the assessment are enjoyable but some are just frustrating like inflating balloons really?,0
"I understand the idea and perhaps the theories of psychometric science that are quoted when justifying the existence of the app and I can fully get behind testing the idea. What I cannot get behind is using this as a tool to screen potential candidates. Solving multi armed bandit problems, impossible infinite tasks and classical prisoner dilemmas may give you insights on some of the evaluated individuals characteristics, but by no means are they a measure of what led to these specific decisions. The results of the test appear to be mostly conjecture and guesses, in many ways easy to influence by biases, algorithmic or otherwise. If this becomes the norm I would very much encourage people to learn about the classical problems I mentioned, we practice for interviews, test and exams, why should you not practice before these?",1
This is good but The name of King Kong is Gorilla but it's ok,1
not coming,0
Beautiful themes.good app,1
Very good feedback in general (from a laptop user).,1
"This is such a useless app. It never connects to my RoG laptop, no matter how many times i restar the application and do every single step for connection. Its better to download share it instead of this for file transfer. And for accessing laptop and control remotely, go for Air Droid. Just uninstall and report this app, doesn't work on time.",0
"Quite fun, definitely challenging. Some levels are a bit tedious.",0
Nice little app quite fun,1
Awful app and awful way to select candidates. Glitches badly meaning you fail and theres no option to retake. Absolutely awful. Would give no stars if i could.,0
"I can't download the app. Already followed the steps to troubleshoot, but still can't download it.",0
Good fun,1
Not enough information to be really useful. I tried to uninstall and get my refund but the app refused. It had no trouble taking my money.,0
"The level of arrogance displayed in the reactions given by the developer here, pretending they have developed the perfect personality test. About the game, the one with the two teams: are we going for profit maximization? The fact that there are two opposing teams would make you think so. Think again, it's about altruism. Really? The ones with the balloons and the electricity felt way too random to be really meaningful. And the faces were too poorly drawn for giving insight in emotion recognition",1

Very Good,1
"A thoroughly disappointing experience. I was left deeply unimpressed by what seemed to be a series of tests of reaction rather than anything else. This was the first time I have had an Arctic Shores psychometric test for a job, and if I see another position that requires one, it will be a negative consideration in a decision to apply.",0
The app describes how to complete each task and while they are mostly simole they can also be difficult.,1
My first game based assessment. Was fun,1
I don't want to be forced to share my location... Edit after developer review: Not all functions require location - if I am going to use only those who do not require location - I do not want to allow location in the first place...,0
"Very poor app, We don't know Mobile and Laptop connected or not.",0

"Android app not even opening, let alone working",0
Nice,1
It was frustrating at first coz my phone didn't support but when i did It on a friends phone i found that the concept of it was amazing. I enjoyed it. Some of them can be frustrating at times lol and some of them needs to be explained abit more. Some games need to replaced. But i loved it. I would recommend this anytime that those 5 hrs assessment anytime lol,1
"The most recent update to MyAsus has killed my webcam functionality. On one hand, it forces me to use this app, and then still fails. I had paid for Droidcam X to use my Pixel as a camera extension on my app. It is not a hardware issue, but rather one of this new software overriding an existing app. I have had to buy a new usb webcam. Furthermore, I feel that the permissions required for this function are excessive and I am not willing to accept them.",0
"It was quite nerve racking some of the games, i wasn't sure what to expect but quite exciting. I had to give up in the final round",0
It is exciting and challenging.,1
My laptop keeps asking to pair bluetooth even in sleep mode. It's asking for access in my phone even after shutting the laptop. I am aware that privacy is a joke but not so blatantly and up front.,0
Never used online game style testing before so as yet can not give a clear opinion. Never played a video game as I find them antisocial.,0
Super Appa,1
Fun assessment. Better than going to a testing centre,1
Ridiculous and not at all relevant to the role. I passed this stage of the assessment proccess and still think it's irrelevant and does not reflect my abilty to do the job.,0

Dreadful,0

"Nice part with emotions and profit for your team. The test with ballons is also quiet good. Other test made me feel awkward for the company I apply. I'm affraid some test are more oriented to test a computer, not a person. At least not a person who think before acting.  It takes more than 50 minutes if you try to do your best.   It's not relaxing. But it is totally better than a psychometric test provided by a person.  I would love my future employer to treat me and other people with the same patience and care that I used to complete this test.  My final opinion is positive, I like such changes in recruitment process. I am really curiouse to learn those tests meaning.  Thank you.",0

There is no point for this app to exist at the first place.,0
I had to complete this test to apply for an engineering position. Every game is entirely about reaction time. I spent over an hour attempting the lock picking question as it was literally impossible. The object moved so fast that my screen couldn't refresh and update adequately. I think by using the app it has made me see that maybe i shouldn't work for the company.,0

Very good,1
Fun but career destructive. As a disabled military veteran. I failed a job application purly based on my ability to engage in a game. I have compromised manual dexterity and coordination. You lose points based on speed. No adjustments for disabled people exist. So inadvertently I have been discriminated against.,0
How is my cognition so low on this test yet so high on most professional psychometric tests I've done. It's incredible how unreliable tests like these are actually used by government institutions. Also... the electrical power generator task instructions were very unclear.,0

"I was quite surprised that I did pretty badly at the facial expression round, I've done the same excersize at university with real human photos subtly changed to show micro expressions as used by Paul ekman, and I was the only person in class to correctly identify all the expressions; found it more difficult to do the same thing for the animated faces admittedly. Interesting app, just not sure that the results correlate to accurate findings. I am BPS accredited in psychometric test administration and scoring, so this was quite a different experience.",1

Most of the questions are about speed, yet at the end you will receive a 6 page report with a variety of characteristics.

Why use animation instead of real Human faces in the emotion question? I'm Lucky this job wasn't a big deal",1

I've had it with this app once again it failed to connect to my phone I'm sick and tired of it not working I have uninstalled and I'm telling my friends do not use this app it's just not worth the effort,0
It was fun and challenging at times,1
its ok,1
Can't get the login,0

Very bad app,0
This app is awesome,1
This app is designed to discriminate against older workers by excluding them from the workforce. i have no idea if I've done well or not but I will not be pursuing a career with any company that blatantly discriminates against experienced workers by employing this app. This is clear cut age Indirect discrimination as listed in the Equality Act 2010.,0
No idea where my files got stored in my mobile Need to open this app every time to acess the files I transferred from pc that to from history No storage location information and that's too uncomfortable other than this it's awesome 😁,0

This scucks butt,0
Fantastic way to test the mind,1
"Never done anything like this, but it seemed to me to be a memory and speed reaction test game.

"List of recent apps has one for each converter plus start page which is weird. When entering values, opens full keyboard rather than just numeric. Can't search or filter ingredients. Would be nice if default ingredient listed could be selected (like something you convert regularly) rather than agave syrup because it's alphabetical. BUT, decent layout, most accurate ingredient conversions, and most comprehensive, detailed list of ingredients. Cooking temp is handy. Substitute guide would be nice addition.",1
It should have a try mode for every stage to make sure that u understand every mini-game. Santander choose the worst way to analyze candidates.,1

Apparently your results are thought to be stable to your personality for several months, but having done this test over 20 times, I get a completely different result each time in the feedback pdf!! I honestly think it's really shocking and a real shame that employers are now using these methods to filter out recruits. What a sad sign of the times.",0
This app does not have the photo of pearl,0
So this is just a collection of click bait mobile games... but I am being judged for my suitability for employment based on my ability to succeed in them... what kind of dystopia am I living in? The results did not reflect my personality either. Embarrassing for all involved...,0
"Very low quality for shared camera. Delay, grainy image etc.",0
"It is quite alright but not a perfect behavioural test. For example, task one is very logically designed to check the ability how one can remember things. Although I wasn't content with the safe lock task at all. It went so frustrating after about 30 mins with only 16 keys, and I gave up. I honestly thought this had no real connection with real-world problems except how fast you react to something and how keen you are. A human attention span is merely 8 seconds and that was a difficult task",0

This is the most insulting thing I've ever been asked to do for a job. Not only is it not a test of any quality of how you perform a job but it strongly favours you having a powerful phone. Oh I forgot to add if yo have played TES Oblivion there is a whole section directly copied straight from the bartering mini game.,0

"Perhaps a useful suite of tests for some high-pressure workplaces, but like other reviewers, I feel that the emphasis on reaction time and visual processing obscures the measurement of behavioural traits such as persistence. I hope Arctic Shores continues to innovative going forwards. It was good to see some multiculturalism in the app, and I look forward to seeing future tools that take this further. I would recommend that employers not overemphasise this tool in their assessment process.",1
Needed a phone number not just internet. What a disappointment.,0
"This app treats you like a robot, and when you write a review, the developers answer like a robot with copy-paste and this shows a disrespect towards the feedback provided. No doubt there's neurological research behind the game, it's the execution people are questioning. Unless you're ready to accept any criticism, don't bother answering, it just comes accross as arrogant, because people's livelihoods are at stake and a GAME is the deciding factor. Of course they are upset, don't patronise them.",1

"""Please update"". This keep popup when I open the app, meanwhile I already update.",1
Ridiculous and childish to use this for hiring. 24 year old so I like using my phone for assessments but this was by far the most ridiculous thing to make someone do. Does not accurately represent whether someone is suitable for a job. The app itself is nice but what it is used for is not.,0
The worst assessment I've ever participated in. Can't believe this is used to employ people.,0
I think that would be helpful if we receive a report about our performance during the games because I didn't receive mine and I don't know how I was.,0

"While all the psychology seems to be in place, and it seems there has been effort put into it, ultimately it's a failed attempt of gamification. From poorly modelled and rigged faces used to measure emotion to frame issues on a modern device. I personally don't agree with scoring a personality test, despite doing well in it, there's no need to pit people trying to find jobs against eachother. I did like the format of which they give you the results via pdf, and I do think that this app has potential",0

"Enjoyable, imaginative and well thought out games except 2 requiring fast hand/eye co-ordination. I enjoyed all of the games for what they tested and the parts of my brain that they exercised.

"just a friendly reminder for people who's about to do the numerical and verbal reasoning assessment after receiving the second invitation. both of them are the hardest for me comparing to the other psychometric tests Ive done. The numerical questions actually assesses your command of english as well. Because the questions are uttered in a rather complex manner, in both sentence structure and logic. I actually stuck on understanding one of these questions and then kinda ruined the rest of thetest",1
"I thought one of the tests was on infinite loop (safe combination), so I abandoned it after what felt like 20 minutes. Also, if you're going to test peoples' ability to read facial expressions, it might be a good idea to use real people in real situations rather than ""Identi-Kit"" mock-ups. If it's not real, then surely the idea is flawed. But then I'm probably a Replicant anyway ;-)",1

"So upset, I was a prison officer for two years and had to leave due to family reasons. Now I am able to rejoin but I'm forced to take this test.

"I think most of the assessment was totally inhuman! I felt like the company doesn't care for what I have to offer. They are only interested in my ability to be a good robot.

"Really like the free version. The Analog looks great. I decided to buy the premium settings and was a little disappointed.( I was really hoping the date had an option to be less long (just include day number) when on analog.)  It also seems before you buy that there are a lot of customization, but there is very little. I really wish there was support for Android 2.0 complications on this. That would make premium more than worth it for $0.99.  I do still REALLY like the watchface and think it is one of the best looking analog faces. I just wish they had invested more time into the premium version.   If this was updated with complications, then I would HIGHLY recommend the premium version. As of now, I'd stick with the free version if you like the analog.",0

Waited over 5 minutes for this to download and install. Cancel. Refund. Bye.,1
I would prefer to take this assessment on my laptop. Why is this not a web application? Then everyone can choose whether a phone is really the best device... The mobile screen is just way too small and in general manipulation with my phone distracted me from thinking about the tasks. Also an option for skipping the task would be useful.,0
The last game was challenging. Besides that it's a mind blowing game.,1
Good,1

Very interesting,1
Most of the topics were based off reaction time. Not something I would consider a requirement for a job. Some of the parts of the assessment felt like they were trying to get you to analyse a pattern of slme sort but it was just random. And poorly rendered facial expressions made it difficult to determine the correct answers for some parts. The verbal test was the only highlight. A company that uses this app to determine whether or not you get the job. Maybe I'd be fine not working for them.,0

"UPDATE BELOW This is the shenanigans that social science majors in HR come up with. A complete joke. This is just used by companies as a way to automatically cut a large portion of candidates without taking the responsibly for that thus protecting themselves from any claims of unfairness, prejudice, racism and all of that. UPDATE: As I said before, now I have proof. I have two reports less then an year apart, that have completely different scores for the same parameters (like 30% becomes 70%).",1
Saha RUDDlN,1
A short review.....haha....,1
I like this app,1
"This test is a bit too long for my taste. It tries to make you entertain 
but it is a bit confusing. The second game is a pure luck system with no 
real rules. It is I guess how you react on carrot and stick purposes. The 
same applies to the powercut thing. I did not find those tests interesting 
nor intellectually entertaining. I just wanted to basically finish the test 
as fast As I could. Other puzzles with arrows, patterns to replicate and 
3letrician/mechanics were fun as they are real games. The facial expression 
game was quite misleading. Real people will help as graphics are ambigous. 
It is however an interesting concept yet, even if it is mapped to employer 
values. I find the result inaccurate and irrelevant. Gaming behavior and 
human interaction/personality/ work ethics are different and I will find 
unfair for an employer to base appraisal/career progression based on this.",0
"Totally useless. I downloaded the app and could not use it to connect my phone and ASUS laptop. Then I tried scanning the QR code which codes up on the computer on the ASUS Sync computer app. The QR code gave me a Google Play address which when I clicked on it, Google Play said it did not exist. Total waste of time and effort. I yes, I do have the correct version of Windows 10.",0
Basic but nice to have color options and add complications.,1
Great app! Almost everything i need in one place. One thing I would like to see is a link to the MSDS when you tap on a chemical.,1
"I enjoyed the game although I think it required fast eye - hand coordination. I also think that specifically the cognitive abilities are measured by that. I have read the response to the same prompt saying it's all based in psychometric. Still, without knowing exactly what task measured what skill and how I remained not totally convinced by its reliability. I have started to do some research on this subject, if anyone wants to talk about his/her experience please get in touch.",0
this game sucks the first 5 minutes I got 3 ads.,0

We need more time to process large amounts of information and that's impossible when it moves on in one second if you're deemed 'too slow'. I really feel singled out because of my difficulty. The even/odd task, tablet price and directions were too difficult and not user friendly for all. Feels very unfair to be judged.",0

"Truly a disgusting method for companies to use to assess potential employees, discriminates against those of us who have lowered reaction times from physical injury.

great,1
!!!,1
i love it,1
Doesn't even wokr,0
Did not enjoy this at all. Time based games cannot assess behaviour. The automated report only goes to show how bad these things are. So inaccurate it's laughable. Edit: I think you'll find I completed the assessment as per the instructions. I also apparently passed it.,0
"If you want to discover and to experience Switzerland you NEED this App. The idea and realisation of the different dialects is great fun and shows how a small country as Switzerland surprises us with many different traditions.

Very good,1
App was alright albeit the exercises were completely silly and followed no logical pattern at times. The results were the worst part since they made absolutely no sense. I have never had something of this sort (a test or quiz) describe me more inaccurately. So proceed with caution... why this would be used in professional settings is beyond me.,0
A fun app that tests a variety of cognitive skills.,1

"Overall, it was an enjoyable experience. This assessment is solely game- based and explores between others your attention to detail and memory skills, and your ability to use your logic. For an overall - more valid- image of an individual's behavioral and personality traits, a questionnaire exploring their reaction towards situational scenarios would be beneficial.",1
"I liked the games, the hand-eye coordination ones were tough!",1
Installed it to use my mobile camera as a webcam but its not working even im not getting option to connect it.,0
Nice and easy game,1
Having previously played Yellow Hook Reef; I was disappointed with Skyrise City. Too many of the excercises seemed to be based on just reflexes or guessing without sufficent evidence. Putting the frustrating lock game just before the comprehension section was also frustrating. I thought the Yellow Hook Reef was a better example of testing.,0
Very good app👍 it guides you in every levels 👏,1

Unreliable. Only worked for the first time. Never worked again. Uninstalled.,0
Good effert But add a colum for serch .as user add mane of ekiment or compound formula show in serch result . thanks,1
"I am convinced the positive reviews here are bought and paid for, in majority. and others who had a bad time probably feel threatened to post their name to people in charge of their potential future job. Some assessments had practice runs and others did not, in the sense of a fair 'game-based' testing either all have a practice run or they do not. this was the first game-based i've come accross that had some with and some without. This app claims as well that people dont need a gaming background is ludicrous since some of the game are time based and would require people to be quicker than most, even if it is just tapping one button or another. would also benefit the user if an average score of an assessment for their own benefit of saying i need to be better or im going okay. A score at the end of each assessment is a nice touch but means nothing if you dont know if its a good bad or okay score. also in the final assessment it prompts the user saying you can leave this assessment at anytime however you wont be able to return to it. it should say you can leave this assessment at anytime however you will not recieve points for completion, in sense of fairness the wording should be that. Also the leaps it takes in its assessment, i would love to see the science behind it because apparently i am both, ""someone who tends to deliberate carefully on decisions that take risk"" and also ""someone who makes decision on intuition rather than someone who makes rational based decisions"". Would love to meet someone who also thinks deliberately about things yet also someone who makes decisions on their intuition, if you exist. also claims that i make decisions based on my more personal needs rather than that of others, again would love to see how my physcometric analysis of 9 game based physcometric tests concluded that. That being said their marketing team deserves props for getting a lot of companies to adopt this.",0

"Very good, and clear app, quite fun at times.. Also frustrating when you get it wrong... Sign of a good app by my standards. Really enjoyed it in hindsight.",1
The app is a great & useful tool it has a variety materials that a Chemist use. Its handful for undergraduates. The app is incredible and has potential. I don't gave a 5 stars rate because I thought it has a MSDS tool to access faster to those compounds student works with in the laboratory but possibly can be added in a future that essential tool.,1
This game so bad,0
Couldn't download,0
Good fun and very helpful for my coordination,1
I applied for a prison role and was denied based purely on my game results. They did not ask anything else. Any company that will refuse you purely because of game results is not a company worth working for. As clearly they are not invested in you as a person. waste of time.,0

"This app is a horrific assessment of a job candidates capabilities. It's a test of patience and how much the person is willing to put up with it. It is frustrating and cruel to put people through this experience where they feel they have no choice but to play these dumb games, when it's such a simple thing to do to help get a job. I feel like that company that directed me here has no respect for my time or intelligence. I have no intention of working for them.",0
The absolute worst application process I have ever participated in. Mostly assesses your reaction time. The electrical lever level made no sense at all. The balloon level is a total joke. The facial recognition is hilarious at best (also no need to move the tiles for selecting the facial expression). Companies who use this in their application process should be embarrassed.,0
"Really creative and fresh, I love it.",1
"Interesting, frustrating and thought provoking.",1
"I highly recommend this app for psychometric tests, it test your strength when it comes to problem solving and being able to memorize things, one could see where he/she lacking and where his/her strong points are.",1
Very much a gamer oriented assessment tool,1
This isn't working on my g15 strix laptop. (1.5 hours into setup struggle) My HD video cam connects with usb-c as well so this laptop sucks with connectivity. I have to choose between a 2nd monitor or Web Cam! If you take the web cam away then you need to improve I/O on the product and preferably more usb-c connectivity.,0
Hmp using this to get staff. I'm street wise not a computer geek.,1
I found it fun as I do enjoy tasks or games that are similar to brain training.,1
"Didn't give me the correct ""game"" and I failed the job application I was doing it for. Thank goodness the recruitment have been understanding that it was the app issue and not myself, they are giving me another oppurtunity. This could have gone very different.",0

"Great concept, an option that doesn't involve a forced Microsoft login. But the fact that I can't save the password in the app NOR use autofill is a deal breaker. My passwords are long, I'm not typing it in every time on a phone keyboard. If you add a save password feature, I'll be back for sure.",1

"Hi Dev, Unfortunately did not support Huawei P30 pro. So i can install but canont open. :-(",0
Overall I'm satisfied with the experience but there are several issues. 1) you should change the faces challenge. Or maybe see the data and change the faces that most people do wrong. 2) Score means nothing without a total to compare it to. Also some info about the score would be useful. Is the score sth like an iq result? Is it average? Is it below or above average... Some stats anyway,1
I did the test twice today for 2 different employers and got different results. The tests were identical. I suspect people might not be successful because of this. I bet if i did it again I'd get different results a 3rd time. I have reynauds and my fingers went numb from holding my phone so long.,0

Reminded me of the games i used to play as a child.,1
A terrible and dystopian vision of the future. The does not test your personality its an IQ test. Some of the games make no sense. The faces game- most looked totally neutral until it was too late as when I saw other faces of that character I realised. You don't have any idea how many lever presses you have left in that game. Even a genius would fail each test eventually so maybe that's the main point here. Employers that use this as a method to test staff should be avoided.,0
More enjoyable and accessible than traditional tests.,1

I would also not advise you to use it on a tablet as the distance between 'buttons' is much further than if playing on a tiny mobile phone. Although I can understand that it is trying to analyse strategy, it's not an effective method of understanding a candidates thought processes.

Worst app ever...,0
Think you,1
Kept closing after every shot,0
"Only tests speed and reaction, does not show personality or capabilities",0
captivated,1
App would only be good if it supported remote access but it doesn't on Windows 10 home which is what everyone has so it's pointless,0
this just seems wrong.,0
Buty full game but not download,0
New update has lots of problems,0
"I completed the same test twice, 1 year apart and it gave me an entirely different report. Arctic Shores might try to get out of that by claiming their assessments are only valid for 9 months, but I doubt my personality did a complete U-turn in that time. The science behind these things is flaky at best, it just gives employers an excuse to not read applications if they get too many. Edit in response to reply: if that's the case, your norm group isn't big enough for repeatable comparison.",0
I like it.,1
"This just tests reaction times which is incredibly discriminatory to those who are less physically able, the disabled, and older people. And the other tests are incredibly abstract and have no bearing on an individuals ability to perform in a job role. I have done the same tests for different companies a number of different times and always have different results, there is no internal consistency with these tests. Companies should not use this discriminatory and poor form of assessment.",0
You guys ruin link to myasus Previous when i share file from my phone it is easily get share i.e the connection for laptop shown always whenever i tried to connect But now after this update i cant able to do that same,0

When i clicked the meme review one it was the one i was thinking of,1
App worked well but i feel you should be able to try the practice run first unfortunately for me I wasn't told about the practice app till after! That part should be made more clear,1
Fake application,0
A interesting and delightful experience,1
Shared Camera disconnects after few seconds,0
Good experience after playing this game.,1
"Can't even send a simple file to my pc without long and tedious connection shenanigans EVERY TIME. ""Your phone"" app works infinitely better",1
"App is good, but please add photo captured sound off option.",1
Can you please add download button cause it is impossible to set everytime using internet if you give add button we can save it into our devices and set it later offline otherwise I would give you 5star this app is so cool,1
not going to let go in the app,0
These tests are getting more and more silly. Popping balloons is now a measure of your ability to do a job. Welcome to 2017,1
"It was a good test, but it was unclear what the results at the end meant, as there was no indication of what the maximum number of points available was (on the rota test)",0
challenging but fun,1

this game is terrible,0
For some reason it's asking me to update when i open the app and i uninstalled it and reinstalled it and yet it's showing the same problem...,0

Very interesting game and it opens ones level of thinking,1

Nice,1
I rate this becuase I couldn't play the game becuase it keeps but ads you can keep the ads on but stop putting them on,0
Worst experience.. Not responding correctly.. Errors.... If asus really want to provide best service to customers.. Test yourself before launching features,1
"Great games, with clear instructions.",1
It was very mind challenging but enjoyable at the same time,1
This game is very bad game,0
not sure if this test is relevant to the role itself but helpful in getting brain to act quickly in decision making,1
was better than a psychometric test.. fun,1
Good,1
"The game does not register my words when it is my turn. This means I get the word wrong, even when it is correct. Tried to shut down and stop casting. No success. Rather disappointing, unless you're not bothered.",0
"Very good, but a practise run to some of the tasks would have been useful.",1
"Really enjoyed taking this assesment today. It was fun, engaging. The instructions were clear and easy to use.colouful screen and use of format I thought it was brilliant.",1
I liked it a lot. It was different from the other tests. Instructios were helpful.,1
Godzilla is not in the game. why every game is king kong?,0
Thoroughly enjoyed completing the levels,1
"Having not played any sort of computer game since space invaders at my local.pub in the 80's, i feel disadvantaged by not having a knowledge if gaming concepts or practiced.hand/eye coordination. Just having to figure out playstore(?) In order to access the assessment in the first place, felt like a test. Having to access and complete this assessment remotely undoubtedly generates advantages for some over others. I THOUGHT i was doing a practice run when i wasnt, and quit one game half way through . Perhaps this should be combined with a hand written psychometric test to make it more of an even playing field for those of us who prefer to hold a pen. You may not need to be brain of Brirain to figure most of these things out, but those who design on line assessments really need to account for the fact that anything is easy when you have knoweldge, experience and a better comprehension of gaming. I have NEVER done anything like this on a.phone. I have felt.torally out of.my confort zone. Its like beinga competent cook, but being challenged to make a cake only using one arm. You have then knowledge to make it, but have to figure out new ways of doing things as you go along. A one armed person is already ahead of you on that one!",0
Excellent,1
Good app,1
Whole thing seems pointless and you feel as though you are doing awfully the whole time. Not enjoyable,0

"Good application it certainly challenges different skills and tendencies, maybe as much as really bad chess, which despite not being as difficult in some ways as the Princes app at grand master level would have the average player swearing by the end of the first ten levels. B-)",1
"I went to play, it wont let me",0
Huge delay in screen sharing.,0
"This made me so angry. How does testing if I have super human reactions prove my ability to do an office job. The report results aren't even accurate, it says I am energised by social situations (I'm an introvert) and I create conflict (I've never created conflict at work)",0
Probably one of the worst experiences out there. Consistently crashes during my assessment and does not even test personality accurately at all. The facial expression recognition game should be based off 'actual' faces.,0

"I am not sure what's happening, in the mobile app every 2 min it log itself out and asks me to log in again, and on the desktop my asus app refreshes bluetooth which makes it to reconnect the device again and again, its just been 10 min since i have installed the app and it has already asked 10 times that my laptop wants to connect to my phone which is annoying.",0
This game is very very bad grafics,0

Very good App easy to use to identify stop and take profit level for RR Can u update it for a 5 Star? Where have option for 3-5 levels of stop loss and take profit so can know where would put SL in front entry rather than have to update the % thanks .,1
Fun assessment,1
Exciting and IQ stimulating,1
It's an amazing app...totally worth it...Although I think u should add more wallpapers,1
I found this app really comforting and the graphics are awesome as well as the sound.,1

"I bought and downloaded this app because I thought it included the function to paste a recipe in, say, US measuments, and get the metric equivalent as an output. But it doesn't do that. If this was incorporated this app would be very good and stand out from all the other apps (that I have seen) in the same genre. Uninstalling as I have no use for it as it it now.",1
It's a good game but where is Godzilla and I don't know why people say there or so many ads there's berley any,0
Very bad👎,1
"I cannot believe that this app is being used as a recruitment tool. While you get the impression that you are being assessed, it's still disguising as a lighthearted activity. I cant believe it is used to determine the success of your application. It has no relevance to the job of Prison Officer. The prison service is understaffed as it is and I despair to think of the good candidates that are being declined because of this game. If you are not a gamer you're in trouble. How is that right?",0

It was exciting a fun. I recommend it.,1
I bought this app a while back and thought is was great. Went to use it again and found out that I cant cut and paste as I used to. What a step backwards,0
"App worked great but as someone with a disability affecting working memory and autism it felt like the games were quite harsh. I didn't seek adjustments from my potential employer beforehand, as I never want to disclose my disability for fear of discrimination, but in this case wish I had as I struggled with 2 of the tests a lot (patterns and faces ones).",0
"Garbage. Long sign up processes and many permissions needed, then it says ""remote access is for Windows 10 Pro only"".",0
I can't find myasus in winre after reset windows..,0
Its not installing,0
Overall a good assessment tool. I found it very relaxing yet I was challenged to think but in a manner where I was comfortable - I think that is very important - to be comfortable so you take the assessments in a very normal state. It gives a perception of the real person in my opinion.,1
Best ring tune,1
Nice,1
"The SL/TP calculator can't be correct & in fact, It's not correct.

Please let me know. We learn each day. Thanks",1
Fake app. Does not work at all.,0
I like this game it's realastic I love this game,1
Best,1
Loved it but not happy with the new release. The digital display won't fit on one line.,0
App was decently made. My assessment was entirely about recognizing patterns in number lists. i never thought i was great with numbers but i never knew i was this bad.,0
I dont know why you've made something that is so obviously impacted by imput method as a means of employment,0
Great way to complete the test!,1

"Lots of information displayed well. The ads are fine, but I'm tempted to say this is fraud... you say to click an ad and wait until it loads and the feature will unlock. Doesn't work. Another ad you say click it and wait and the ad will disappear for an hour. Doesn't work. That took away 3 stars, and it's close to being reported if it doesn't get repaired.",0

"Most puzzles were alright, none were too complicated though one seemed to only have a pattern you would've worked out by the end of the puzzle. Reaction based tests were annoying, since the pauses given for failing a question also decreased in time along with the questions speeding up, which is completely the opposite point entirely of having pauses to begin with, and there ended up being a point where they became more an issue than the actual test. Otherwise, a good testing measure, nice idea",0

Fine,1
This game is have alots of adds and if i click to play he will give me add and if i click in the modes he will give me adds and the game has no godzilla and why u are put godzilla vs kong image i will delete this game this game needs like 1 download or 0 good,0

overall it was a really good experience.,1
Most rubbish job application testing I had done ever,0
It's fun but need pa practice to do it,0
What a sad world we live in for employers to use this as a mechanism to shortlist their candidates. Clearly whomever is buying into this are a company to be avoided. The thought that a game of fluke and reactions can decipher one's personality which has been built through many years of personal experiences from baby to adult is laughable. A job application is a serious process that can make such a huge difference to someone and to use this method is worse than not being sent a response at all.,0
Enjoyable but could do with more options to take a break.,1
Clossing between playing,0
Biased for younger people who have quicker reaction times,0
Not entirely positive as i dont play computer games usually.,0
"Okay, few small issues with buttons too far apart, lost points as a result",0

Absolutely useless. Either after your latest update on here or Windows made the app unfunctional. Can't detect my phone at all and I waited nearly 2 minutes. Tried with Bluetooth too and it didn't work when it used to work fine.,0
"I had no technica challenge throuout the assessment, that was my biggest fear when I was about to start. It is generally good, but hey, more room for more improvement",1
"After one point, you have to be a robot to be able to keep up. I really don't know how a memory game has to do with our confidence, but i am not a scientist so i can't judge.

"One of the worst methods of assessment on the planet, I can't believe that PROFESSIONAL companies are using this garbage to assess applicants!! Being a gamer doesn't mean you'll be good at your job, this is absolute utter garbage. I've worked at two professional companies and excelled in both... If a company is using this game to get rid of applicants then that company is NOT forward thinking but lazy. My character is NOTHING like the results show. Take time, find applicants in a traditional way",0

RR Hi,1
I've done this twice now both the same sort of assessment on a different application which was called Amazing Insights. I do not see how this reflects accurately on an individual. And some of it is literally impossible to finish. That lock assesment is impossible on both apps. I'd like to see proof of people who complete this rubbish. In fact I would like to see how this tells you my personality because it doesn't prove anything about me or my intelligence.,0
This is a game or adds lavadaa game.irratating game,1

"Good Lord it's a privacy nightmare and you can't install it to use the functions you might like without consenting to permissions you do not want. I was interested in fast file transfer between phone and laptop, but it would take longer to sign in on both devices than ould to just email it to myself. After I deleted the app, my dad rang my mobile phone only for the laptop to answer the call. Why would I want that? Where did I consent to that? Talk about red flags. I'm now going to have to review the Windows 10 app to see that should go and I'm more annoyed with Asus than I've ever been.",0

Excessive collection of data and indicates only use data for managing account but contradiction in actual policies,0
I do enjoying the assessment is about reaction make a good sense,1
"At first found this a pretty good idea. Then while actually doing the tasks I realised that you need inhuman reflexes to complete the tasks. There ""fail"" sound puts you off and is a destruction and has absolutely nothing in relation to your behaviour or probl solving skills as some tasks are based on luck like the balloons or power charge which at 1st seems to have pattern but then randomise half way through.",0

"Gamified psychometric testing is bad practise with zero conclusive evidence that it's an accurate or reliable test of personality. It's sadly telling that Arctic shores failed to provide a single reference to a scientific paper on their website.

Psychometric psychology is legitimate, but that's regarding 'big 5' tests. This type of gamified version is unfounded",0

Pointless and inaccurate beyond belief! You decided I was slow at data analysis yet I analyse data daily at work. You have my cognition skills as low and yet I have a distinction at Masters level in History. As a result of your rubbish app I have lost out on a great opportunity.
